        - Had my first contact with production-level application development, working on a platform used by more than 10 000 users that allows the university’s community to create and submit standardized online forms, thereby easing the maintenance and sharing of the school’s information.
        - Developed  3 robust backend endpoints for the platform, enabling dynamic information processing within standardized forms.
        - Designed 15 intuitive and user-friendly frontend interfaces, including a specialized form creation tool, allowing users to create forms tailored to their needs. This tool empowers users with the ability to select from various form elements and apply conditional logic.
        - Worked with diverse teams of 5 elements, including developers and designers, on a collaborative environment for brainstorming and idea exchange, to create user-friendly forms, improving the submission process for the university community.
