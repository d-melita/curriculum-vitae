      details: | 
        - As a part of a research initiation fellowship granted by IST, I was able to have my first contact with production‑level application development, working on a platform used by around 10k people that allows the university’s community to create and submit standardized online forms, thereby easing the maintenance and sharing of the school’s information.
        - Worked with diverse teams of five elements, including developers and designers, on a collaborative environment for brainstorming and idea exchange, to create user‑friendly forms, improving the submission process for the university community.
